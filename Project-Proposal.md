## 4. License and Contribution Policies
The Liberapay project has very lax licensing and contribution policies. The project is listed with the CC0 Creative Commons License, which allows the code to be used wherever and has little to no protections for the project. This will allow us to examine and contribute to the project freely. The license has allowed the project to be extremely free with regards to the contributors that help develop the project, with over 1000 issues and over 900 pull requests. The project has no official contributor agreement or processes. The primary way that individuals contribute to the project is be raising issues and submitting pull requests that are approved by a smaller core of developers. Other than the developer oversight, no restriction are made to submit issues and pull requests.
