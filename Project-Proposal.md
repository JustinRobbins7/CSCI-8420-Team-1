## 3. Project Description
Liberapay is a non-profit organization that enables individuals to support the people who build free software and spread free knowledge by donating toward their work. As an organization, Liberapay provides an accessible web platform where people can donate money recurrently to various teams, organizations, and individuals and crowdfund workable incomes for these creators to accomplish their work. Liberapayâ€™s users are composed of both donors and creators, and all processing payments are currently supported through Stripe and PayPal.

As an open-source software project, Liberapay has a well-established codebase that is currently maintained by a large development team of 477 contributors with 17,280 commits made to the project. The source code for this project is primarily written in Python, but the codebase also uses other programming languages such as SQL, HTML, JavaScript, Shell Script, Make, XML, and CSS. Since Liberapay was launched 5 years ago, this project has generated a high amount of user activity and reported the following statistics as of September 9th, 2020:
- 32,988 Open individual and organization accounts currently exist on Liberapay
- 5,144 Active users gave/received money within Liberapay for the latest week
- The sum of active donations for the latest week was $6,941
- The sum of donor charges processed for the latest week was $6,930

## 4. License and Contribution Policies
The Liberapay project has very lax licensing and contribution policies. The project is listed with the CC0 Creative Commons License, which allows the code to be used wherever and has little to no protections for the project. This will allow us to examine and contribute to the project freely. The license has allowed the project to be extremely free with regards to the contributors that help develop the project, with over 1000 issues and over 900 pull requests. The project has no official contributor agreement or processes. The primary way that individuals contribute to the project is be raising issues and submitting pull requests that are approved by a smaller core of developers. Other than the developer oversight, no restriction are made to submit issues and pull requests.

## 7. Teamwork Reflection
While determining which open-source software project to investigate for the course, each team member was tasked with researching three different software project ideas and reporting them back to the team for discussion. During the team meeting, everyone presented their software project ideas so that our team could collectively evaluate the pros and cons for each project and then agree upon which selection to choose from. Based upon our brief analysis of the different project selections, our team decided to use Liberapay as the open-source software project for further investigation in this course. While no major issues occurred during the project proposal phase, our team plans to continue making important decisions collaboratively as a group and gathering together at least once per week on a Zoom call in order to report our progress with each other and keep everyone informed about the latest tasks that need to be completed.
