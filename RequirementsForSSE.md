## 1. Use/Misuse Case Analysis

### 1.1. *Use Cases*
 - Identify five essential interactions of your open-source software (system-of-interest) with its environment of operation. You will most likely identify these interactions based on the enabling systems or other systems in your systems engineering view from the previous assignment. Ideally, the interactions need to be spread across different external interactors (humans or systems) of your software. Once different external interactors have been identified, the interactions can focus on the most sensitive features used by the external interactor. 
 - Develop use-cases diagrams related to the five interactions. The use-cases should be about features supported by your software (system of interest) 

### 1.2. *Misuse Cases*
 - The misusers should be contextualized in your environment of operation and relevant to the interactions identified above. Use names for mis-users that help the reader understand their motives, resources, attack of choice, and the available access to the system to carry out their attack.
 - Iterate between use and misuse cases to elaborate additional security functions. Embed the final diagram in your report.

### 1.3. *Reflection*
 - Assess alignment of security requirements derived from mis-use case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Summarize your observations.

## 2. Liberapay Documentation Review
 - Review OSS project documentation for security-related configuration and installation issues. Summarize your observations.

## 3. Planning and Reflection
 - Include a link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task. 
 - Include a reflection of your teamwork for this assignment. What issues occurred? How did you resolve them? What did you plan to change moving forward?
